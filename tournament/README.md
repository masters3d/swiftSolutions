# Tournament

Tally the results of a small football competition.

Tally the results of a small football competition. Based on an input file
containing which team played against which and what the outcome was 
create a file with a table like this:

```
Team                           | MP |  W |  D |  L |  P
Devastating Donkeys            |  3 |  2 |  1 |  0 |  7
Allegoric Alaskians            |  3 |  2 |  0 |  1 |  6
Blithering Badgers             |  3 |  1 |  0 |  2 |  3
Courageous Californians        |  3 |  0 |  1 |  2 |  1
```

The outcome should be ordered by points, descending. To keep things simple ties
are broken by looking at the number of wins and if that doesn't solve anything
by ordering the team names alphabetically.
